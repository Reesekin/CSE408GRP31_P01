 Most criticisms that could be levied at Reddit could be levied at any forum-type app that gives
users a voice. However, I find Reddit to be endemic of this particular problem to a much greater
extent than its competitors: namely, it gives gives idiots a voice. More than that, it gives people
of mediocre intelligence and education an exaggerated opionion of their own perspective, by creating
a kind of equitarian bubble where everyone has equal say. While this might sound nice on paper, realistically
some people really would be better off remaining silent and being thought the fool than opening their mouths
and removing all doubt. Never before have I encountered such asinine opinions anywhere else on the web than
I have on the boards of reddit. I swear the posting system they've built practically encourages people to disagree
for the sake of disagreeing. While this may sound like more of a critique on the users than the app, I think it's
within the responsibilities of Reddit's designers to alleviate this problem. How? By instantiating a mandatory IQ
test before a user is allowed to post on the website, along with requiring real life identity being attached to posts so
people can see your face. Perhaps with these policies conversations might be less dominated by the dregs of society.
