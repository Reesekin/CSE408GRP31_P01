The user experience of Snapchat is extremely cumbersome. It is intended to be a messaging app between friends, but has several features that serve to hinder this messaging experience. One of such features is the 24 hour limit of messages. 24 hours after sending a message, it will disappear unless you explicitly tell the app to save it by interacting with the message after it is sent. This hinders the messaging experience as there is added pressure to open messages within a certain timeframe in order to not lose said message, as well as making saving messages far more tedious than simply autosaving them like most other messaging apps do. There is also very little to no privacy on the app, as certain information like who someone is currently talking often to and in some instances precise locations of some users is public information unless toggled off, making users that value privacy far less likely to use the app. They also try to display articles for you in a separate page from messaging, but I have found the articles they show to be pretty useless to what I would be interested in seeing for a social media app. You're also unable to search for articles of certain kinds unless they are tied to sponsored users, which makes finding new content really tedious.

    Overall would not recommend using Snapchat.
