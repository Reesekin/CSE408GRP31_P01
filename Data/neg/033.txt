I think that Twitter is probably the worst multimedia app since it really is a simple app but people utilize it in an ugly way to me. More often than not, most fake news or bad facts are from someone's tweet. I just don't like how people utilize the app to get as much attention as possible by being as loud and controversial as possible. I think the app is just relatively uninteresting and isn’t really driving much creativity. There are probably lots of other really bad multimedia apps out there that just are not used since they are bad. I just am not that big of a fan of Twitter. Instagram and Facebook are also terrible multimedia apps in my opinion. Facebook has the worst security and business practices for any big tech company out there. Almost every week “meta” has a data breach or is caught selling its users' data without their knowledge or consent. Millions of people have had their data leaked with all of their personal information and they try really hard to cover it up and make it seem like the platform is secure. I also think that all in all social media apps like FaceBook and Instagram cultivate extremism in a way where you will always find a group of people with radical views that pollute the platforms with misinformation that can really be harmful to our society.
