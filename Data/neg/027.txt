Write a few sentences (over 200 words) stating why you feel the above App is a terrible App.
Snapchat is the app I choose because it does not offer as much content creation compared to other modern apps today. The appâ€™s main purpose is to take a picture of whatever the user wants, either themselves or surrounding objects. After taking the picture the options are to send it to a friend, upload it to your story, as well as saving it to the user's snapchat saved album of photos. The time content created on the app, however, is limited to 24 hours or a few seconds, only small windows of time to share media. This is unlike other media apps, where the ability to look at other media is available until the post is deleted. The app's circle of viewers is also way more limited than other apps. All the people able to view any content are those added through search or contacts, and cannot be random people who happened to discover the post. This could be seen as a positive and  can also be compared to the private account feature on instagram or twitter, but overall it is permanently set to private on snapchat. The ability to connect with others is then lessened. The filters on snapchat can portray a negative perception of oneself, and personally are not up to par with other filters on apps like TikTok.
