I personally have Instagram and use it on a somewhat regular basis, so I feel 
as though I am allowed this critique of it. Instagram is an app where people share
pictures that they have taken as well as captions. In its ideation, Instagram seems 
semi harmless and innocent. In reality, it is the root of so many problems that 
circulate around social media. It gives a platform to those that shame others for 
the way they look, and allows for people to edit anything about themselves and post it
with any viewers left to assume that it is actually what people look like. It is very 
harmful to younger people with body identity issues and insecurities. They get to see
people posting bikini pictures and beefed up gym pictures and think that normal people 
are supposed to look like that. Back in the day, everyone could see exacty how many
people liked your pictures and high numbers of likes became a mark of high social 
status. Instagram literally gives a platform for predators to target underage people
all via direct messaging. Even if they are not following that person, it shows up as 
"hidden messages". I was a victim of this at 14 years old. Some person reached out to 
me on Instagram and tried to start a "relationship" with me claiming to be 19 years old.
I am pretty sure that they were a catfish though. No harm done at the end of the day
because I never let it go far enough, but I guarantee you that not everyone is able to
be so lucky. I still get messages to this day from "sugar daddies" claiming to want to
send me money (even though it is just a scam). Instagram actually sucks.
