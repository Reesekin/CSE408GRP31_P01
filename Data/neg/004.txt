AZ Screen Recorder enables you to, as the title suggests, record your phone screen as you use your phone (it also allows screenshots as well). However, in my experience, the quality after screen recording is actually downgraded and not in high quality. In essence, the amount of pixelation in recordings is more than noticeable. There has also been several instances (in my case, at least) where the recording ended up only showing a black screen and not the actual phone screen. Also, another thing that I dislike about the app is how outside noise is also recorded. In other words, if I record my screen while in a loud setting, I can hear the background noise very clearly, which is more of an inconvenience than anything. This forces me to actually be in a quiet setting while recording my screen, so one can see how infuriating it can be when you want to screen record on the go. Not to say it's the most annoying aspect, but it definitely slightly defeats the purpose of only recording your screen. Furthermore, there are times where the quality of the recording is better, but it is just not as consistent in quality as I would like. Finally, the user interface could be better laid out.
