 Reddit is one of the worst social media sites I’ve ever seen. Their core idea to constantly feed users content on a monumental scale is so well done that people are addicted to the feeding and constantly just scroll through content for hours on end. Reddit has thousands of communities called subreddits that are for specific niches (e.g. individual video game subreddits) or very broad subjects (e.g cats or movies). It sounds nice in theory but some of these posts get thousands of comments where some people just get furious over the littlest things. The weirdest thing is that people create bots to post popular images from before and use them to farm karma and re-sell it online. It’s no chump change either, these accounts go for $30-$50. Reddit is also home to some of the largest echo chambers since subreddits are created for individuals who think the same way as each other. Dissenting opinions on non-political posts are met with some of the most hate I’ve ever seen. The website front-end swapped over to a ReactJS UI library and it has slowed down their front page by quite a bit compared to their old site (which still happens to exist on a slightly different domain). It’s fine if you have stable internet, but as soon as it starts to slow down, Reddit just hangs forever. This issue does not happen on the old version of the site.
