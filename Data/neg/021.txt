Facebook can be a good software to connect people, however, it has a bad privacy system towards users. Facebook uses userﾃ不 information to calculate what users might like and cause users to stick to their phones which leads to serious addiction. By using the Facebook, people can have negative psychological thinking and feelings, especially in the age group of teenagers. They are very easy to get attracted and impacted, due to the misuse of information, they will experience jealousy, stress, depression, and importantly social media addiction. Social media addiction can lead to more serious problems like wasting time, decreasing motivation to strive in real life, and eventually it will take over your life. One example of what Facebook is doing to us: when you post a comment, the reward system of Facebook will cause you to want more likes or retweets, if you didnﾃ付 get any from anyone, especially from the people you care about, you might feel yourself not important to that person, even society. Facebook also propagate harmful information just because thatﾃ不 popular, which can mislead the users, especially young ones who donﾃ付 have much their own opinions. Overall, Facebook is not a good multimedia application in my opinion.
