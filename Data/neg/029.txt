The ASU app just has a very dated display, in my opinion. It's not as sleek or modern of a design, compared to better apps. It also has such a confusing set up. The menu tab you can click to open has too many options, a lot of which could have been combinined to make the menu tab shorter. It also signs me out every couple of days, and so it's annoying to go through that process over and over again. The settings to personalize what the app displays is hard to get to, and because I am overwhelmed with all the information on the app, like the weather, my schedule, COVID updates, athletics updates, etc., I rarely go on the app unless absolutely necessary.
