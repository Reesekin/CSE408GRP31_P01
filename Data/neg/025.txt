I listed Facebook as a biased answer. I was never a fan of Facebook as it had connotations of being used by an elder generation, whereas now we have Instagram. To me, Instagram was a more "hip" Facebook and it helped users get their pictures across very easily whereas Facebook seemed more clunky and appalling to look at. Although Facebook had a lot more features, they were not originally intended to be there, and eventually, it seemed more like a cash grab, and a way to make money off the app. Again, my answer is a little biased as I grew up using Instagram as opposed to Facebook, and I didn't really see a good way to use Facebook as I was growing up. Facebook didn't have that ease and appeal that Instagram did, and so I was never a fan. Although I did use Facebook to get connected to a few people I do not know. Instagram recently added an explore page where you can see people you don't know, and posts that are trending, although Facebook did have a "groups" section which allowed people to form communities, which seems interesting in wanting to connect together, although, in terms of Multimedia, and wanting things to come across nicely, Facebook didn't meet my standards.
