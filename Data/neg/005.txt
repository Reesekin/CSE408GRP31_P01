I don't consider Rave as a bad application. However, there are some issues that I don't like dealing with. Watch party is mainly to watch a movie or any video with "distance"-friends, but, from my experience, Rave doesn't open some videos from either Netflix or Youtube if the two people are watching from different countries. Also, sometimes I can play some videos, but my partner cannot see that a video is played.
