This application does not exist anymore but I had to use it for a long time eventhough I hated it. 
Samba is a bank name in Saudi Arabia that I used to be a customer for. I did not like it because it 
was slow and was temporarily not working mutiple times since there were some improvement to be done. 
However, it never got better. When you log into your account, it has to send a code to your phone for security. 
This was an easy process when I was in Saudi Arabia and using my Saudi number. However, when I am here in the US, 
I have to change my SIM card into my Saudi number and wait for maybe an hour for it work then the code is sent successfully. 
The application did not have the feature of logging in using your face id and this by itself my thing a lot harder for. 
I did not like the design of the application. It looked very old fashioned although I have used it until the end of 2021. 
The developers did not seem to care to upgrade the user interface to be easier to navigate and more pleasing to look at.
