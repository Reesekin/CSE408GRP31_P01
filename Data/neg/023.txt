There are too many bad advertisements in the world that poorly utilize multimedia aspects in general. While they do try to draw in a lot of attention for whatever purpose (get a consumer to be interested in a product, invest in their business, buy from their web shop, listen to their mixtape, etc.), I think that its completely oversaturated and most ads do not fully utilize text, images, or sound in a good manner. They ultimately turn out to be bad and looks like something done in MS Paint in 5 minutes. Advertisements in general also just suck and I think most of the world would use advertisement blockers in web browsers to eliminate them from YouTube videos and pop-ups. There can be many forms of advertisements that use different multimedia forms, which we see mostly through video ads (use images/video, text, and audio), music/radio ads (use audio, or maybe even video/image on the app), and static ads (images/text). These can be used in different ways like pop-up advertisements, which is one of the worst forms of advertisements since no one likes pop-ups and advertisements. Blocking up half the user interface of say a phone or web browser makes it incredibly difficult to get the content that you want and you tend to dislike whatever company/ad is popping up as well, making it a double negative.
