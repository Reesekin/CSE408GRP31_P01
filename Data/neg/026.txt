I may be a bit bias since I got hacked and have only used it when I was younger, but I feel like Facebook is outdated now. The design of Facebook felt odd to me and I feel like the password recovery is annoying to deal with. There also was an issue where some games/apps that users used a Facebook login with had to have the Facebook app also installed otherwise the login would not work. Facebook is rather old now and I feel like Instagram/Tik Tok now does Facebooks job better. It was also somewhat similar to Reddit where there would be niche groups created for certain people, but I feel as if the interactions between poster and postee was not as good to look at compared to Reddit. Also Reddit’s interface and search feature allowed users to switch between tags/style of posts very easily. The only reason why I would use Facebook is due to signing in on games that would reward players for using Facebook sign in. After I hadn’t used Facebook in a couple of weeks, I was hacked and whoever hacked my account followed a bunch of Indian chat groups. I tried deleting my Facebook account but in the end it never got deleted. I was able to recover and reset the password however.
