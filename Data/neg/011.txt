I do not have or use many multimedia apps, but of the ones I use most often, this is probably my 
least favorite. Instagram is one of the most popular multimedia apps of our generation however, to me 
it always seems to push people to show their life in an unrealistic way. This due to the fact that many 
people's goals with this application is to gain followers and likes at dreams of becoming famous in some
 way. I find this to be harmful to many people whether they realize it or not. Though users can share 
updates on their lives in forms of images or videos and post comments, it seems to me many people want 
to create an image of themselves that is unrealistic. Social media platforms like this, like most, are 
addictive in the desire to scroll through the pages endlessly, comparing your life to others. While I 
have a created account, I have not used it at all nor do I have the app itself on my phone. I have been 
shared some funny videos/memes that were posted to the app, I still think the cons outweigh the pros 
since the negative impact of comparing lives to other fabricated lives is hurtful.
