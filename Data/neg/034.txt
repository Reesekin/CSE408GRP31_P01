I have a strong distaste for Craigslist. I think it has so much potential but constantly feels restricted by its UI. It has such limited functionality and prevents one from finding things that would be so much easier done if it was better designed. All of the functionality is highly obsolete. It seems as if the application was made to intentionally drive people away from it. It would be nice if it was more functional simply because one can get such good deals on things they need. I feel as if the app could be utilized in a more user-friendly way. The application has the most proprietary aspects that almost make if a deterrent. It would be more useful if the application was utilized for less essential things. Oftentimes, people will be scammed on the application. The way to reach out to sellers is also incredibly proprietary. It seems as if the developers never really cared to fix any of the issues. This is a sign of laziness and poor application development. The front page has several different errors with it when going to it from a UI standpoint. I strongly dislike using this application and I honestly hope for it to improve.
