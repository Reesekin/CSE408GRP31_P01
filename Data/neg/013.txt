I feel Instagram has taken a turn for the worst in the last handful of years. This app has become extremely toxic and gives off a fake facade to peopleâ€™s lives as well as reality. With the amount of youth now involved in this application, their minds are altering with how they feel they need to look or what they need to have. This app has recently changed its algorithm to tailor what they want you to see rather than just letting the normal front page be the people one chooses to follow. They have started to really push what they want you to see. Not only is your main feed ruined, but this is the one place fake news has been populating. Nonfactual information has been seen more than enough times and really shines a light on the quote "Don't believe everything you see on the internet". While this app's initial thoughts were to have a place everyone can freely express themselves, this sadly is no longer the case. With the number of filters and photoshop and face tune, everyone uses you can never tell what is actually real. The algorithm has also because extremely sensitive and really has taken people's freedom of speech away from them. You can not only get flagged but your account can become completely disabled just from a word or image being shown. The algorithm sees or hears slang that has different meanings the youth say and assumes it is meant in a harmful way and will immediately hurt one's account activity. I truly believe this app causes more harm than good.
