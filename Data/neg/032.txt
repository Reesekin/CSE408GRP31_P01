Facebook before was a genuine app enabling Individuals to speak out to the open network. It was formed to connect individuals for the very reason that its slogan reads, It “Helps you connect and share with the people in your life.” Unfortunately, it doesn’t fully separate users that uses the app to be able to control their own atmosphere/bubble. It very much so brings its users to a reality that they may never foresee than what it was before. It’s very the reason for why I don’t trust using the app let alone even deleting existing accounts that I’ve made before in the earlier stages of my life. Facebook in today’s world has been utterly contemptuous to its users, for a big company as it is, the app never delivers its promises, instead it brought users down to an absolute dreading experience that can no longer continue. This includes concerns towards its customer service and their efforts to provide it even poorly in the first place. The App has plenty of opportunities for improvement by those working under the app, but now its own developers and owners won’t spend a single dime on it. We also haven’t gotten into the content it provides and now the platform has been used to incite genocide and mob violence in countries around the world, meanwhile its toxic effects on teenagers’ mental health and amplification of medical misinformation during the pandemic years make the case that Facebook is a threat to public health. These are just a few concepts that can be dived deeper, but as of now, the story is very clear.
