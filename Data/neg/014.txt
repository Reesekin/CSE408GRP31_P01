Youtube Shorts, the idea got from Tiktok. The worst part in my opinion 
is that Youtube Shorts have nothing to do with Youtube. It came out last 
year and people start using it at the begging of this year. Why did Youtube 
start Youtube short I think is tiring to let users spend more time on youtube 
when they are on their phones. However, youtube decide to pay the short video 
maker less and copy all the updates they got from Tiktok. One of the major 
ones I think is making the video unskippable. Instagram and Tiktok having it 
are just because people are using the app to fill their blank time and youtube
is very different. Youtube made their app a different place to watch Tiktok 
and tried to use the same way Tiktok and Instagram get their user. I think 
I have the worst experience when I try to use youtube shorts also because youtube 
doesn't allow the user to check their youtube short history to force users to subscribe. 
This made youtube short worse because people are using the youtube app but can't use youtube 
in a youtube way. Youtube couldn’t make them short different and can’t make their app Youtube 
made me think this become the worst multimedia app in these years.
