OfferUp is a great way to find and buy used goods but the way it is done is very flawed. In my experience using the app 90 percent
of users send one of the pre-selected messages "Hi, is this still available" and even if you respond within seconds they just read 
your message and never reply again. I think this is due to the fact you can only rate the buyer or seller if they are the one that 
purchased it and then you go in and manually confirm it was the buyer or seller. If you could rate anyone you interact with people 
would be more apt to reply and more curtious of the messages they send. I believe the way offerUp is set up now leads to faulty ratings
of buyers and sellers becasue say you are a seller and you were rude to the buyer but they still purchase it, you know they will leave 
a bad review but you already sold them the item so you can just never verify it was sold and delete the post. Theres no record of you 
ever selling the item and your rating never goes down this way. There is a few other small annoyances with the user interface of this 
and just the overall layout.
