Adobe Premiere Rush is the watered down version of their enterprise video editing solution, Adobe Premiere Pro. It was probably deveoped in response to modern social media. More than ever, people are finding themselves in need of a fast, mobile-friendly way to edit short clips for social media. It initially launched in June 2018 as part of their Creative Cloud service, and was primarily targeted at the small laptop and tablet market. It sucked so bad dude. 

One problem was that the mobile software market was already more than saturated with video editing apps. Take a look at LumaFusion, for example, which still holds the crown as reigning iPadOS video editing champion. Adobe had to compete with apps which had already been development for years, meanwhile Rush CC was not necessarily "feature complete" at launch. Of course, it was buggy, as many v1.0 apps are. The worst part, however, was the user interface. Adobe had a difficult time deciding whether they wanted their interface to be pointer-oriented or touch-oritned, and it showed. iPadOS still lacked decent cursor/trackpad support at this time, and yet Rush CC had little to no use cases which were applicatble to the Appl Pencil, which was the shining star of iPadOS at this time. 

Today, the app has been made free for all to use, and while it is still supported, major features updates are few and far between. I still like Premiere Pro though!
