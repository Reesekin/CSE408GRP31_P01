While TikTok as a platform itself is fine, the effect of the content posted has many negatives among young people. There are plenty of examples of people doing unwise things to follow TikTok trends, with the result of these things being hurt people and/or damaged property. Many users seem to have addiction problems to TikTok as well. While addiction to social media is not limited to just TikTok, the design of the app seems to be more effective at causing addiction problems than other social media like Facebook. There have also been many security concerns about TikTok, which is owned by a private Chinese company. Given the popularity of TikTok in the US and many other countries, people have rightful privacy concerns as the app’s privacy policy shows that it collects a lot of information about users such as location, usage information, and IP addresses. On Android phones, TikTok also collected IMEI numbers which is not authorized by Google’s Play Store policies. In August 2020, Trump threatened to ban TikTok along with other commonly used Chinese apps such as WeChat in the US. In India, TikTok along with other Chinese apps such as PUBG were banned in June 2020.
