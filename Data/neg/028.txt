I dislike Facebook because I think that, while it serves its purpose to its userbase and also acts as multimedia hub like Reddit, Facebook fails on the user end in multiple ways. It misuses (and has been legally proven to secretly track) user data for monetary purposes, whether that is for advertising or calculation for the algorithm to decide what posts to promote for better traction. On top of that, it also enables a wide variety of misinformation and doesn't seem to have an effective system for dealing with such issues. Reddit has subreddits dedicated to a variety of topics, and each of those subreddits has its own moderation team. Facebook seems to have less of a connection between moderation and community, and as such, certain communities can spew absolute lies and even be rewarded for it, as Facebook's algorithm understands that more interaction (as controversial posts such as misinformation tend to generate) creates more revenue, giving false information and hateful posts more traction. Aside from that, the amount of spam notifications you get is insanely annoying, the platform feels much more artificial than any other social media, and it feels like there is no real sense of anonymity or safety on there, making it much less comfortable than anywhere else.
