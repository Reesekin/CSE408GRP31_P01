Of course, YouTube is a very good application. 
But the reason why I chose YouTube is that I spend too much time using YouTube. 
I tried to watch YouTube for a while, but sometimes it went over an hour or two.
To find the problem, there may be a feeling of helplessness caused by the inability 
to accept a vast amount of information, or rather a phenomenon of insensitivity to information.
