Snapchat, even for people who have used this App for so long, is very difficult to navigate. For example, if I want to change my snapchat avatar I would spend at least 5 minutes every time trying to find the correct button in settings, because the updates change the entire layout every time. It is also common for users to accidentally create group chats when they mean to share photos and videos with individual people. I have had this mistake occur multiple times with the people I follow. Not only that, but the constant ads when viewing peopleâ€™s stories can be annoying to deal with. Sometimes Snapchat does not even allow the user to skip the ads, and forces them to sit through a 10-20 second video in order to resume to the next story. The app is also dangerous, as it allows users to show their location whenever they have the app open. While I have my location turned off, I can easily see the locations of many people I hardly know, which can be unsettling to think about if this information is given to people who would use snapchat locations for stalking purposes. All in all, although the quick photo snapping feature is convenient, and the filters are very fun to play with, the snapchat app is not worth it at all to download in this day and age when there are so many other multimedia applications that can do similar, or even better.
