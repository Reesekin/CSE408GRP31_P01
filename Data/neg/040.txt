I do not like the Crunchyroll app because it does not compare at all to the other streaming services on the market, such as Netflix, Hulu, etc. The app itself constantly crashes and the video streaming quality on the app is terrible because the stream oftentimes will not play at a constant quality. The transition between episodes is also not as smooth. The support for dubbed anime is also a little wonky in that it creates new seasons for dubbed versions of the show instead of showing them in a more accessible way. A lot of the time, the subtitles on the dubbed episodes do not match what is being said in the audio. On Roku, the Crunchyroll experience is a lot smoother than on the mobile app, so the inconsistency in the quality of the user experience across devices bothers me. Also, the fact that there is no button to skip the intro or move on to the next episode is a big disadvantage for me because it means I have to manually scroll through the episodes to skip the intro and move onto the next episode. This can be really frustrating and annoying especially when I am binge watching and have to put extra time and effort to get the streaming experience that I want that is supported by other streaming services, but not Crunchyroll.
