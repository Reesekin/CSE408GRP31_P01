I strongly believe that Snapchat is the worst multimedia app on the market. There are so many bugs especially on the android platform. Snapchat feels like it is targeted towards iPhone users. The app doesn't fully take advantage of the camera on android phones. Most of the android phones have really nice cameras. When you receive a snap from someone, it is easily to tell that they sent it through an android or iPhone. The quality of the image or video is drastically different. Snapchat also doesn't store previous messages automatically. This can lead to potential harmful behavior. This can encourage cyber bullying. People will continue to abuse that feature and send inappropriate snaps. This form of cyber bullying can lead to many sucidies and depression among teens and adults. Thanks to quick delete feature on this app, there is no paper trail and it would be difficult to capture proof. There has been a rise in bots. There is no moderation in terms of who you can add. There are many many bots that add random people and send a scam message trying to bait the person with some kind of virus. All the reasons are why Snapchats is the worst multimedia application in my opinion.
