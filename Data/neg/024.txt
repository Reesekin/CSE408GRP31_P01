I believe that Roblox is one of the worst apps because it is such a low quality game and looks like it hasn’t been updated in years. On top of that, it is also one of the most successful games ever, which doesn’t add up in my point of view. It seems like the developers care more about seeing how much money they can make rather than how good of a game they can make. I think Roblox gives the software/gaming industry a bad reputation.
