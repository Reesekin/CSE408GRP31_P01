Twitter to me just seems like a self-defeating application. While its interface is definitely passable and easy to memorize, its focus on small posts betrays its many of its taglines over the years. Such taglines included phrases like (but not to be exact) "It's what's happening in the world," or "you heard it first on Twitter." The focus on the small post (less than 280 characters) forces anything analytical to be split into threads, and its limited filesharing (be it videos, GIFs, or images) also limits the ability to share or convey any valuable information. In addition, it seems like my main timeline was sorted somewhat randomly, with some days-old tweets showing up before tweets that are just minutes old. Attempting to copy pictures from the website can also be difficult at times, because the posted files lack standardization (some are PNGs, some are WEBP, the latter of which doesn't save easily on my desktop).
