I consider (specifically) the browser version of YouTube to be the worst application.

The mobile version of YouTube is very functional and acceptable in quality, but bugs and oversights in the original website render it nearly unusable on personal computers. On some browsers (such as Google Chrome), many screens fail to display any thumbnails or text, from search results to playlists, making it nearly impossible to navigate between videos and destroying the usability of the app. Even on browsers where this issue does not exist, audio on most (not all) videos is extremely quiet on anything below maximum volume. This is not just an OS or mixing issue - the built-in volume setting on the video player has little effect on its purported function. These bugs have persisted for months and directly tie not just into multimedia, but the core functionality of the website. More general features of the platform introduced recently have also presented smaller issues. Dislikes on videos no longer appear, making it more difficult to gauge the quality of any content, and videos "targeted at children" (according to an automated process subject to a hefty amount of false positives) and music tracks have comments disabled, reducing the platform's sense of community. Once again, these changes have been heavily criticized and have persisted for months.
