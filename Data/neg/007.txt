The first time I came across Snapchat was sometime in the 8th grade (2014/15). My friends introduced me to the app,
        and I loved it. There was nothing like this app at the time. I see it as one of the most innovative multi-media apps 
        ever made. I still rank Vine and TikTok above it, but Snapchat was up there. It was not up there for long though, 
        which I will get to in a bit. First, let's talk about the innovations Snapchat has made and how it forever changed the 
        game. Snapchat's landing page on the app is the first thing I want to talk about. When opening Snapchat, the first 
        thing that opens is your front view camera. I believe this was the first social media application that had a camera 
        view as its landing page. The usefulness of having a camera on the landing page is that you can quickly open the app, 
        take a photo or video of something, and instantly share it with your friends. It was a quick and convenient way of 
        sharing the world around you with your friends thus named “Snapchat”. It was instant. Also, they had disappearing 
        messages which was the best thing about the app. They have a feature called stories where you can view your friends' 
        photos and videos “snaps”. Instagram quickly took note of the Snapchat stories feature and implemented a better 
        version of it into their app. Snapchat was also not making a profit, so it filled its app with invasive ads when 
        viewing a friend's story and was adding too many unnecessary features that made the app undesirable. People loved the 
        basic, simplistic Snapchat. I wouldn’t call it the worst app ever but after all the nonsense ads and features, they 
        added it became one of my least favorite apps and the worst amongst the multi-media apps I currently use.
