The worse multimedia app in my opinion is Snapchat. Although snapchat does have many unique features available compared to its competitors. Snapchat is the worse multimedia platform because it has a terrible user interface and makes it difficult for consumers to use hence the reason why they get a lot of complaints when publishing new software updates. Snapchat also has a lot of security issues in my opinion. Often a lot of individuals including myself find themselves getting hacked or having to deal with many glitches with their personal accounts. Another security issue I find with snapchat is people having access to location unless you manually go into settings and turn it off. These are very bad components incorporated in Snapchat. Snapchat also lacks a lot more functionality compared to other social media applications. Its dull and limited functionality makes it only good for a short quick chat. Also, unlike other platforms snapchat is not good for keeping up with national/global news events. Snapchat is also one of the leading visual platforms that contribute to give many teens/adults anxiety, depression, and have a negative impact on oneâ€™s mental health. Snapchat dull and lack of new features makes it the worse multimedia as there are far more better options in the marketplace. Until the security issues, user interface, and lack of functionality snapchat is one of the worse multimedia apps in the current day of social media.
