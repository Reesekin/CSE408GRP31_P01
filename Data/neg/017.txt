In my mind, TikTok is a little *too* good at showing users content which reflects their own beliefs. It is incredibly addictive, and promotes shorter attention spans and increased division politically and ideologically. I feel like people "like" TikTok in the same way that people "like" heroin. That is to say, while the platform is addictive to its users, it is not productive, and very little positivity comes out of the app. I cannot name another app which has to show its users messages suggesting that they have been too active, and should take a break. Such behavior is wholly unhealthy, and indicative of addiction.

		The effect that TikTok has on user's attention spans is awful. Of course, in today's world, it is normal (and expected) for attention spans to be decreasing, but by limiting content in such a short-form way, TikTok enforces this shortened attention span. Users become incapable of paying attention for a longer period of time because they have been conditioned to ingest short-form content.

		Not to mention that the entire app is a data mine, which preys on the interest of users to collect mass amounts of data and sell this to outside organizations. Absolutley nothing positive has come out of this app.
