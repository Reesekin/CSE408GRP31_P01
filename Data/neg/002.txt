Facebook hasn't always been the worst application in my opinion but the way it has evolved over the years has made me rethink my decision otherwise. When the application was first created it was a great new way to connect with friends, family, and other people from all over the world. I remember using it all the time when I was in middle school to message friends, post pictures, update my status, and much more. When other applications like Snapchat and Instagram came out those just started taking precedence over Facebook and it eventually died out in my eyes. I no longer like it due to the various advertisements and it not being used nearly at all amongst people my age. I view it now as an application that older people still use to connect with their friends and family, but with new platforms that are better and more interactive I just donâ€™t feel like it evolved with the times. I also feel like the importance of doing things like updating a status i.e. relationship, feelings, etc. is not something that really matters as much as it used to.
