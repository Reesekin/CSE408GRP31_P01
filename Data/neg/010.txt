Write a few sentences stating why you feel the above app is a terrible app: I find TikTok to be one of the most fascinating and also strange multimedia applications ever created. Many people view the app as the spiritual successor to Vine, which was another media app where users could create videos capped at a certain short time limit, encouraging innovation and creativity to create entertaining content to fit within such a short time frame. I would tend to agree with this sentiment, but TikTok has taken that mantle as the spiritual successor and amplified all of the negative tendecies of people on social media apps. Specifically, it has become commonplace to throw dignity and common sense out of the window in exchange for likes and video clicks on the apps. There have been countless new stories about trends on the app that actively encourage people to partake in obviously dangerous activities. If people aren't spreading and partaking in dangerous challenges, then they are filming themselves doing the new flavor of the month dance, making a fool of themselves to appear either attractive or funny, and often failing at both. I really do find it fascinating how so many people are eager to partake in these things on TikTok, all for the purpose of obtaining online popularity that is ultimately meaningless.
