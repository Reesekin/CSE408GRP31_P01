Many years ago, I remember Facebook is a place where you connect with your friend, play game while browsing interesting feeds. It has so much potential to become an all-in-one social media platform in the past, but I guess it’s just like a quote by Mark Carrigan – “You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain”

In recent years it got so bad because of many privacies’ scandals and whistleblower that accuses Facebook of manipulating people mind. However, I feel like even without those scandals, the platform kind of turning into a big chaotic melting pot that try to harvest as many moneys as possible through their advertising business while also lose track of what their users really want.

I believe overall Facebook is still one of the most impressive pieces of Apps in the technical standpoint. Some of the service Facebook provided like Facebook Ads is still the main tools for many businesses around the world to advertise their business. A lot of small business couldn’t survive without Facebook today.

However, I feel like Facebook is like a very chaotic bazaar that full of spam promotion, Fake ads, scam but at the same time it is a place where people can still find some useful information if they look closely. 

Every time I open Facebook there is always full of notification with the mix of “good” and “toxic” posts. I think one of the reasons is that Facebook algorithm like to promote hate and drive toxic content because those posts drive more engagement from people like reading, liking, and replying to the post. Thus, people lose trust and confidence in Facebook’s contents, and it became a terrible App for average users. It has everything but yet nothing at the same time.
