Currently, Instagram and Facebook have all (if not most) of the functions that Snapchat has,
	plus many more. The shared features include sending temporary photos back and forth, private
	messaging, story posts, news, and viral videos. I see no need for Snapchat to exist anymore.
	Also, I think the parts that overlap with other apps are worse on Snapchat than its competitors.
	The biggest difference between Snapchat and other social media apps like it is the ability to
	have a permanent profile or presence that is built upon over time. Both Instagram and Facebook
	allow users a space to create lasting content and join communities. There is no permanence with
	Snapchat, nor any shared groups for people to truly collaborate. The point of Snapchat is that
	it is fleeting which I can acknowledge, but I do not understand the point of it anymore since
	the other apps have fleeting features as well now. Additionally, I think the app encourages poor,
	even creepy, behavior from its users which is generally harmful to the younger population. I think
	about when I had Snapchat in middle school and what I went through, then I wonder what the point
	of making the app was in the first place. In general, I see no need for it.
