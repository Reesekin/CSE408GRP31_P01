Reddit is my favorite among many multimedia App because it is the best overall platform that allow users to discovered and join different quality channel/community based on their preference. 

It is incredible sources of information that cover almost every field of human knowledge. Users can browse through many different sub-reddit in philosophy, computer, space, science, human etc. Anything that you interested might already have a sub-reddit for it. 

Although there is other platform that provide the same channel-subscribe functionality as Reddit; but is the quality content and helpful community that set Reddit apart. If Facebook is people you know sharing things you don’t care about, Reddit is things you care about shared by people you don’t know. Thus, browsing Reddit is about finding your own people and learn about the thing you care.

Reddit have put a lot of effort to keep the platform doesn’t end up like Facebook where there are scams, ads, spam, low quality content, toxic comment everywhere because Reddit allow the channel mods to set aggressive rules to keep the vibe of the community as quality, positive and delighted as possible.

Also, what set Reddit apart from other multimedia social platform is that it allows users to reach very specific channel/people that share the same interest, even the weird one; This allows users to discovered and ask questions that only people with same interest would know while gaining information from each other. This is very useful because some specific questions can only be answer by people with specific experienced, and Reddit is where you can find them.
