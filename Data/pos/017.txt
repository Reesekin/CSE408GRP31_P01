Snapchat is super easy to use, ubiquitous, and always changing. The developers this app iterate quickly on ideas and aren't afraid to try new things out. Filters are fun, posting stories is fun, and chatting with images is a pretty novel form of communication. 

		I like these things because, personally, I find myself getting bored with written conversations. Of course, it is possible to maintain an exciting conversation over text or email, but adding a multimedia element to the conversation keeps it interesting, even if the content of the conversation itself is getting dry. There's something to be said about an app that adds meaning to conversation, even if the content of the words themselves are not particularly interesting. 

		I also recognize that my propensity towards this app stems, in part, from the fact that I've been using it for a long time. It can be hard to break the habit of using apps, especially if these apps connect you to others. This describes the relationship I have with Snapchat. I have been using it for so long, all of my friends are on it, and I feel like it truly does enhance conversation in a meaningful way. This is why I like Snapchat.
