Write a few sentences stating why you like the above app: I like YouTube because it's one of the most unique products I have access to on a daily basis. The ease of access and ease of use for me to find any kind of video content I'm looking for on-demand is something almost any other digital product is really not capable of doing. The wide variety of personalities and content creators is also something that can't be found on any other digital platform, there's a very large amount of entertaining creators for every topic and kind of content. Personally, I've been using YouTube for many years of my life and I still use it often and daily throughout my current day-to-day life. Whether its watching gaming videos or educational content for topics I'm curious about, like world history and programming, I'm generally always watching something on YouTube while at my computer desk at home. Within the same notion, while I often use YouTube as a source of entertainment for myself while doing work or otherwise, it is also a great source of knowledge to expand my own mind. I've learned a lot of both niche facts and practical/useful information that has helped me in many situations. For me, the product that is provided by YouTube is truly irreplaceable.
