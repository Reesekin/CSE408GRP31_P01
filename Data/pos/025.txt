Twitter allows the user to express thoughts and images across the internet in a very simple way. The application makes it simple for the user to post images, or just express their everyday routine or something silly all together. Twitter also brings people of a similar community together. The app brings people of a similar community together as most people that follow each other are part of a single community and the likes of a user are publically shown to other users in what they call a "timeline." The timeline allows us to see other users' posts that we wouldn't normally find because we do not know this user but through the connection of someone else we may know, we get to see another user's post. By creating this timeline of people we do and don't know users are able to easily access the profiles of one another with a single tap. This brings them to a timeline of the user's posts only categorized in media, and tweets and replies to see how this user interacts on the app and helps the user make a decision on whether they want to follow someone they don't know yet on the app.
