I liked watching movies a lot since I was young. In the past, there were not many 
platforms to watch movies or videos. Therefore, I used to watch movies on the 
computer using the GOM player. The GOM player has so many users that it can be said that 
everyone uses it in Korea. GOM Player supports file playback in various formats 
such as AVI, MP4, MKV, FLV, WMV, and MOV, and Windows can find codecs, play damaged 
files/downloading files, and recommends subtitles suitable for automatic subtitle 
sink control and playback videos through GOM Player, which collects more than 10 years of data.
