 My favorite multimedia application is Discord because of the functionality of it. It has several different aspects that fit different needs depending on the necessity at the time. For example, one of the necessities of Discord is the capability of it to be used for small scale groups to large scale servers. Within these two examples is a plethora of customization. For example, with individual groups, one can set group profile pictures, set names, and perform administrative tasks. However, at the more large scale comes in so many features. Some of those features include the capability to moderate and customize to a tee the administration capabilities of those who are not the owner. It is a very nice feature that one cannot delete the server unless they are the owner. On top of this, there are so many features to be added. One can make text channels, voice channels, announcements, set different pictures, etc. Another facet of discord is the way it structures its paywall. One can utilize the application without ever putting in money to access necessary features. With features like Discord Nitro, one can simply make their experience better without the cost of putting others at a disadvantage.
