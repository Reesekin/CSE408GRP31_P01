Spotify is a music application that you use to save and listen to music on your PC or mobile device. It has a variety of features that makes the user experience unique and easy to interact with. The library of music available is very large, and you can find nearly anything you might enjoy listening to. While this could be seen as an encumbrance since finding new music can be intimidating to some, they mitigate this by curating songs for you that are similar to the ones you already have saved. You only need to show the app that you like a handful of songs and your page will be populated with songs that are either similar or well liked by other users that listen to the same songs that you do. Even beyond this, the app will display songs that you haven't listened to yet that might deviate from what you normally listen to, but could get you into a new genre of music that you wouldn't otherwise think to listen to. Also available in the app is a playlist feature, where you can put together songs and listen seamlessly between them. Every playlist comes with recommendations that are similar to the songs contained within that playlist, making either finding songs you already enjoy or finding new songs that you might also enjoy much easier than scouring their library for new songs to listen to. 

    Overall, a very solid user experience and I would highly recommend using Spotify!
