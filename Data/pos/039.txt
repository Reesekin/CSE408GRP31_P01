FL studio is the software that I use to record music. It can be used for large productions as well as shorter brainstorming sessions. Growing up, I never had an easy way to record my guitar playing or play along with tracks. Fl studio gives me all of the tools that I need to practice new material with a backing track and metronome, explore sound libraries to be inspired for new songs. and finally to write and record those songs. 

I am primarily a guitarist and drummer, but any musician can use the software Everybody uses it in their own unique way. Lots of my friends use it to make beats for their rap and R&B songs. Others use it to make funny remixes of songs that already exist. I've used it to make ambient soundscapes for sleeping, which actually helped me with my Tinnitus, which I have struggled with since I played so many live shows in high school. 

I really appreciate FL studio's ability to be a different application for everybody who uses it. It reminds me a lot of the Adobe Creative Suite, which everybody uses to make their own unique creations. One thing that could definitely improve is the user interface. Sometimes I struggle to efficiently reach the outcome that I want because there are SO many features that it's hard to distinguish which ones are useful and which aren't. Definitely suffers from feature bloat, but I guess that's what enterprise software tends to do.
