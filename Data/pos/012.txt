 I really like Photoshop as a multimedia application. It’s a fantastic tool for editing and creating media (in this case that are text/images/gifs). For editing media, Photoshop has a plethora of tools such as color editing, and layering that has more control on what gets changed for specific sections of an image (e.g. using a masking layer to change the hue of the layer directly below to a different color that doesn’t have to apply to the entire layer), image/color filtering, rendering effects like lens flare, and lighting effects similar to those you would see on stage performances. There are blending options (e.g. bevels, texture, and borders), blurring, smudge, clone stamp, etc. All of these tools synergize extremely well with each other too and there are so many more tools but I haven’t gotten around to using them yet. Photoshop also excels at creating media as well by using those same tools alongside some extra ones like the paintbrush with dozens of pre-defined and user-created brush sets that have limitless customization options like scattering, texture, dual brush, smoothing, build-up, color dynamics, etc. It can also create text that is filled with a different image rather than a solid color which is nice for web development. Photoshop can also create gifs which I haven’t found a use for other than comedic use.
