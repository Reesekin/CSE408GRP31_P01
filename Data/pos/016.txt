My favorite multimedia app is Celeste, a multi-platform video game.

Celeste stands out as my favorite multimedia application because of its skilled combination of gameplay and story to form a compelling yet universally accessible product in a way that the vast majority of video games don't try to. Useful software must respond to whatever input it receives effectively, and Celeste does so at an elite level, calculating very specifically not just what movement the player input for their avatar, but what they *likely* intended to input based on small details and pixel placement. For example, the player is allowed to jump for a split second after they walk off a platform and their dash direction may be altered to the "better" option depending on the exact input. This, combined with the intentional decision to not include lives in the game, makes an otherwise extremely challenging game shockingly accessible and ideal for players of most skill levels. The game also achieves storytelling unique to most software, with an emotional allegory about mental health and self-discovery presented as a trek up a mountain. Metaphors include the main antagonist of the game being a literal "part of" the protagonist who emerges from a broken mirror and the presence of feathers in calming environments and as the hero calms down.
