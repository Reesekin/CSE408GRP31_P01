In my opinion, the layout of the app is very simple and convenient for the average user. With the capabilities of sharing photos and videos with your friends without having to worry about how this process goes, the app becomes addicting very easily. Additionally, when I want to post a photo or video, I can also edit the piece of media to my liking within the app, which comes in handy when you aren't quite comfortable with the editing tools that come on your device. In fact, for what Instagram offers in this aspect, the editing tools are satisfactory. It may not be in line with Adobe Photoshop, but there's plenty of editing options for the average user like myself. Furthermore, the displaying of photos and videos as you scroll through the app makes for a simple, yet effective experience and always leaves me wanting to keep scrolling without end. My family members (including older relatives) also have Instagram, which speaks volumes to how popular and easy to use it really is. In addition, the sharing photo/video feature makes the app even more versatile. I would say I spend at least a couple hours a day using the app because of what it provides for the user with seemingly so little features.
