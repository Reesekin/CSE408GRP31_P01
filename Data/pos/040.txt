I like Spotify because it has a very user-friendly interface and mobile app design which provides for smooth usability and experience on the user’s end. It has incredible streaming quality and functionality when it comes to creating playlists and sharing music online. It is able to accommodate tens of millions of songs and playlists. It also integrates video and podcast content. What makes Spotify exceptional is its own curated content. Its machine learning algorithms is what truly separates it from other music streaming applications, because it is specifically tailored to the user. It analyzes the user’s listening habits and personalizes the music streaming experience for them by creating custom playlists and song recommendations. One example of this is the Discover Weekly feature that I keep up to date with on a regular basis. It helps me find new music that I would like based on my current listening habits, expanding my circle of known songs and artists. This is very engaging and means that I keep coming back to the app to discover more music. This app also allows me to share songs and playlists that I like with my social circle through social media apps such as Snapchat, Instagram, etc., but also over text. Spotify also creates customized playlists for the user based on genre and most-listened to artist. Furthermore, the Spotify Wrapped at the end of the year allows users like me to learn more about my listening habits.
