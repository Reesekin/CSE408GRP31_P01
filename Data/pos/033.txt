 I mostly enjoy TikTok so much since the algorithm of short videos is really accurate to get my dopamine high and entertain me. The speed that it can also display high-resolution videos is pretty impressive. The app database and front end seem to be very well-designed and snappy. I really don't like social media apps and resisted TikTok for as long as I could, but during the pandemic, I cracked and downloaded the app. The algorithm of the app is way too good and I waste a lot of time on it being entertained. Another multimedia application I enjoy is YouTube. I like learning lots of interesting random things in YouTube videos and going down rabbit holes of information. I have been on youtube ever since the beginning and it has been interesting watching the platform change and develop. I also feel like the quality of YouTube videos has gone up, partly due to those around my age who have very short attention spans. So the video tries really hard to keep you engaged. I just have noticed that I enjoy videos as a medium more than anything else since I get the most amount of data from them in the least amount of time. This type of medium always seems to keep me engaged and interested.
