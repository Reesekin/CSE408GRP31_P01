I like Tik Tok because it is a platform that people come to with raw videos. While there is still editing involved I enjoy everyone feeling comfortable enough to express themselves with their own unique content. This app allows anyone to have the chance to gain popularity not just based on looks and money. Yes, there is the normal group of popular creators, young kids from the ages 15-18, that had gained a large following. But the family and the average person that gains enough to gain money through the app is so refreshing to see. Soon after Tik Tok came about it turned into a learning platform, that promotes educational purposes as well as recreational. I personally have learned over a handful of new things or how to use everyday items in a different form. There are millions of people exposed to this app so it also gives an opportunity to network and meet others. This app allows you to meet and see other people that look like you as well has had the same experiences, making you feel less alone. I have seen people post small clips of a song they wrote and be able to sign with a label because of the exposure they gained. This app makes everyone that joins feel welcome with not only the environment but the algorithm they have that tailors everyone to a unique experience. The app uses your likes as well as the accounts you interact with the most to make you enjoy your for you page more. I truly believe this app has a pure idea behind it.
