 Using discord, I can send various types of files to people with ease. The downside to that, however, is that users would have to pay for discord nitro in order to send files larger than a certain amount. I can also express my emotions using the traditional emojis, or a server’s provided emojis, gifs, and stickers. With discord nitro, one could apply emojis normally restricted to servers everywhere. It is also one of the best ways to sort out groups and roles in a huge organization. If I were to run my own server, I can set specific restrictions so that they can only view channels based on the status that I provide them. I could also give people leadership access where they can change channel names or create a nickname for themselves. It is all very customizable and the UI to work these features is very understandable. I can search for information I want on servers with ease. I could search for a message or file based on filters such as time, user, content, or whether it’s an image, if it was pinned, and any type of mention. Discord is one of the best apps out there when it comes to mass communication.
