This app comes to mind because the feed is curated to one's own interests. This includes images that the app's algorithm finds for you. It contains a way to see other people's images, audios and sometimes literature to consume as well as creating one's own personalization online. It includes the ability to upload reels, stories and images and within those posts, customize it using filters, audios, and graphic images. The graphic images and audios can be ones owned by the user or already within the app. The reels are a way to upload a 90 second video, imitating the popular style of tik tok videos. The stories are a quick way to upload a video or boomerang, with customized editing. The platform also contains suggested posts and an explore page to find similar content to the user’s interests. Within all these posts there is a main feature to interact with it, called “heart” or bookmark, or share. To heart it, the user presses the heart-shaped feature to signify they enjoyed the post. The bookmark allows you to save the post to a personal collection, with an option to name said collection, to go back and see the post for whatever reason. Sharing the post means dming the post to a friend.
