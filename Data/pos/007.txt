There are many reasons why I love Instagram. As a photographer, I utilize Instagram to showcase my favorite photos
    to my clients and people interested in creative photography. Most importantly I use it for my viewing purposes.
    It helps me see how far along I have come in my photography journey. I have a visualization of how my style and 
    creativity have progressed with each photo. I am hoping I can inspire other creatives by sharing that visual 
    progression. One of my favorite features of Instagram is the explore page. Essentially, the explore page curates
    new Instagram photos and videos tailored to your interests. They use data gathered from your user activity such as 
    the types of posts you interact with, the profiles you view, the posts you share, etc. As a photographer, I love 
    creating images, especially film photos. My entire explore page is filled with creative film photos, fashion, and 
    beautifully put-together photo collages. This feature has allowed me to discover creative artists and has given me 
    new sources to pull inspiration from. More inspiration means more creativity. More creativity means more creative 
    photos by me. And more creative photos by me equals more creatives I can reach.
