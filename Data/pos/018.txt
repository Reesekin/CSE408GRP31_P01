I like Ableton Live as it is a very intuitive and powerful program for audio processing and arranging. It can also handle video files. The automation controls are intuitive and easy to use and combined with the various plugins allow for a very powerful combination. While other audio editing programs are very good I like Ableton Live the best overall.
