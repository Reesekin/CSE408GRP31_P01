 Users can subscribe to content or hide/don't recommend channels, like posts or videos. 
This allows users to better their own personal experience on the app. Seeing trends on videos, 
community posts, and channels also allows for new exposure for users as well along with recommendations
 based on previous viewing history. They have added to videos a graphical way of showing a video's most 
repeated parts. Its wide variety of videos can entertain almost any user with gaming, comedy, DIY, and 
music content. However, there have been instances where channel notifications have been muted in a way 
so that subscribers cannot see their new content. This along with copyright claims or issues with 
community guidelines not being followed by creators can impede on their ability to produce content that 
many users would like to watch. Nonetheless, many content creators still have the ability to make unique
 videos to amuse users while other channels can gather a following with community posts alone. Overall, 
enjoyable app that I spend a lot of time scrolling through in my free time making me laugh or informing 
me.
