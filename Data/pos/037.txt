I like Spotify for many reasons. First of all, you can listen to nearly any piece of music that ever was released on there. 
You can listen to new or old hits, your favorite movie soundtrack, or a random playlist made by someone to fit with your mood. 
The design of the app is also amazing. They have really intuitive swiping features where you can add a song to the queue or
add it to your likes. You can share your playlists with your friends, and even make joint playlists. It takes away all of the 
shame of social media and replaces it with something so personal. You can find anything on there. I can search up "relaxing 
music to study to" or "relaxing music for cats" and twenty different playlists will pop up. You can also view what your friends
are listening to on the desktop version. You can relive memories on there or find the most random songs and types of music
to the extent that it seems limitless. I know there are some obscure genres that are not on Spotify yet, probably due to a lack
of demand for them. You can also download your music so that it is available to you when you are not connected to wifi (or even
when you have no celluar reception). It completely changed the game of have portable music devices, and wiped out the need for 
an IPOD or CD's. Something to add as a side note is that most of the app is 
green and black. Green happens to be my favorite color.
