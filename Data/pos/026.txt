I mainly enjoy Reddit due to the vast difference in people there are. I am a fan of games and art so there are niche groups for everything I like, including software dev/engineering. It has stories of people’s lives, dark secrets, comics, etc. Nowadays I mainly use it for opinions or news on tech stuff/ stocks. While I understand it isn’t the smartest choice to listen to people on the internet, I do find their opinions to be ideas that I can research further. I do not actively message or interact with people on Reddit but many posts make for an interesting read. I often refer to reddit with many random questions I have as there most likely is a post already about it. Recently I have been searching for many posts about software engineering internships and how to prepare for them. It is surprising to see how many people will respond with their stories and advice to help the poster. On Reddit, links and images are allowed as well so it makes the experience so much better than just simple messages. Another app I use is Discord and I think the only thing Discord has over Reddit is that Discord can make calls and is a lot easier to contact/get in touch with people than it is on Reddit.
