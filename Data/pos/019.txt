 I like this app because it has content from creators all over the world of all types of genres. For example, there is content about technology, entertainment such as music videos, and a lot of educational videos for topics such as math and computer science. Some famous educational institutions such as Khan Academy are hosted on YouTube as well, and I have my own channel that hosts some clips of video games I play. Apart from a few things such as movies, no content is locked behind paywalls unlike other platforms like Floatplane. My mom likes to use YouTube for recipes for new ways to cook, and my dad likes to watch Chinese movies on YouTube. I like to watch content about technology, programming, entertainment such as music videos and anime, and there are many great channels about these. I really like instructional videos as well, such as when I was taking MAT 343 (Linear Algebra) and my professor could not explain problems well but I could find good examples of similar problems solved step by step on YouTube. I hope that YouTube continues to be a good resource for me and I think that it is a great platform.
