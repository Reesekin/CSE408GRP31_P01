I like reddit a lot because it acts as a hub for an infinite amount of information, while also functioning as a social media platform. You can communicate with other like-minded redditors on topics you share an interest on (gaming, music, art, there's even subreddits for figure collectors!) and typically find a lot of helpful people if you encounter any problems, especially with tech. I also really value the search engine that reddit uses because it makes finding information extremely easy, and I think that the way it decides relevancy of posts works most of the time for my use cases. As a social media application, reddit also makes it easy to reply to others, with comments, comment chains, ranking of comments based on an upvote (known also as updoot) system, and even private messaging. Extending the use of private messaging, reddit also acts as a marketplace, where people will sell their things, whether it is shoes, keyboards, or collectible funko pops, and use features like private messaging and commenting to both communicate prices, arrange a sale, and mark an item as sold. It essentially tackles every single possible need from a multimedia app and combines all these use cases into one epic package.
