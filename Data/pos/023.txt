This form of multimedia is very interactive and incorporates images (and subsequently videos), text, and sound to draw the user's attention in. You can be immersed in these applications for hours on end and the developer or publisher will try to use each aspect of the multimedia to piece together a story or a world. This could be storytelling, the use of lore, cutscenes, rewarding gameplay, and so on. Publishers can use motion capture and upscale the environment to add realism to a game environment with sounds and graphics to make a cutscene look, sound, and feel like it was filmed in real life and put into a game. Post-video processing can render green-screen environments like done for movies to help with this as well. Even for non-RPG genres like FPS, MOBA, or even RTS games, the use of certain gun sounds, satisfying hitmarker sounds, visual flairs associated with certain actions, in-game skins, announcer sounds, etc., can help to keep the player stuck to the game more and feel immersed for longer. Having a rating system (text, images, animations) can make players want to achieve a better rank in a game and play for longer.
