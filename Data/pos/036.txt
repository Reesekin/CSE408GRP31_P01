When I first became interested in editing images both for recreational and for project purposes,
I ended up going with Gimp since it was a free alternative to Adobe Photoshop. Since then,
I've become reasonably proficient with the program and it has provided me with the tools to edit images,
gifs, and even make small animations with the wide variety of editing capabilities that it possesses.
Even though it falls short of a paid option in some cases, for the casual and even low level professional user,
Gimp can pretty much easily handle any meme, logo, background, etc. and is also verify intuitive with large
source of documentation online if you get stuck. In many cases, having such a slimmed down piece of software for 
editing can actually be much quicker than using a paid option especially if you're working with relatively simple image editing. 
You can easily add text, change scale, or drag elements on top of a lower layer and export the image within seconds.  
Despite being free, the program does offer some more advanced editing options, including specialized filters, distortion effects, 
and even animation capabilities. While these may not be everything a seasoned professional needs, they have proved to be more 
than adequate for the projects I work with.
