YouTube is something I watch consistently every day and can spend countless hours watching a wide variety of content. I really like this platform because I am a visual learner and would rather learn through videos opposed from reading. I have been using YouTube for entertainment and learning for over 12 years now and don't see myself not using it anytime soon. I think YouTube has so many interesting content creators and has content that anyone can enjoy if they find it interesting. I've been watching some creators on the platform for many years now and it almost feels as if the content they create has helped shape the way I grew up. I would say I spend on average close to 4-5 hours a day watching content on YouTube whether the content pertains to gaming, things happening around the world, or even for educational learning. I view YouTube as an extension of google where you can look something up and almost always find what you are looking for. YouTube has changed and evolved over the years from where it first started and its even easier and more satisfying than itâ€™s ever been trying to view or search for things which is why I still use it today.
