I like disney plus because its a reasonably priced subscription based platform that provides a wide varitey of 
some of the best movies and tv shows ever made. For example they have the entire star wars saga and tv series 
and you can watch them all for one subscription instead of having to buy individually. Another reason i really like 
this app is because for bigger series they have a series in chronological order of the movie timeline not just when
the movies were realsed. In this example im refering to marvel and this a very nice feature that disney plus provides.
I also believe that disney plus is overall a cleaner applicaiton then some of its competitors like netflix and you can 
navigate disney plus a little more seamless than other. Disney plus seems to be more interested in quality over quantity 
as they dont nearly have as much shows as say netflix but in my opinion disney has the overall better movies and tv 
shows. As well disney plus subscription is much cheaper subscription than netflix.So for these reasons I would say that 
disney plus is not only my most used app but as well is my favorite overall app.
