I believe Discord is a great app because it took some basic things that have existed for a long time - text messaging and calling - and took them to the next level. I find it impressive that they were able to improve on something that seems so trivial. Some things that make Discord a great app is that it is free, reliable, easy to use, and feature-rich. The different types of media it is capable of interacting with includes text, images, sound, and video.
