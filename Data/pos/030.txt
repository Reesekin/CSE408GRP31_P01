 TikTok is my favorite multimedia app for several reasons. This app is one of the most popular apps in the world currently. It serves a lot of different communityâ€™s and has a lot of text, image, and sound features I enjoy using. TikTok is very quick and simple and has a nice introduction that allows new consumers to adjust properly. Another reason why I have TikTok as my favorite multimedia app is it is different from all the other social media platforms and reminds me of vine. TikTok allows everyone to express themselves and see/learn from visuals along with text and sound. It is good for giving me a short break when I am relaxing and is very helpful for when I am looking for specific information. TikTok can also be very beneficial education wise if used correctly. I find myself using TikTok as an additional search engine like google. I can search and learn about topics like school, work, basketball, and all my favorite hobbies. You can also share among your peers and gain helpful insights in the comment section. TikTok is not one dimensional like its other competitors but allows me to get a laugh and learn from a lot of things while staying up to date with the current day media.
