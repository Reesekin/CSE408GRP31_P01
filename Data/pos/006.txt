Youtube has a very intuitive UI with the important navigation placed in the bottom navbar of the app. The algorithm for recommended videos on the homepage is accurate to what I want to watch, allowing me to think and click less and get straight into the content I want to watch. Additionally, the thumbnails of each video have a preview feature where users can view a small snippet of a video to see if the content interests them. When watching a video, double tapping on the left/right side of the screen rewinds/fast forwards respectively. Moreover, the viewing experience allows for a lot of customizability. For example, the video player allows users to switch the resolution they want to watch in, including a data saver feature for users who are on mobile data. Also, the video player has built in closed captioning which are autogenerated which caters to users who cannot hear audio well. Lastly, there is a lot of potential for new jobs.
