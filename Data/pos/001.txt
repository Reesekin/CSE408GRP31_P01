When you open the application for the first time, it asks you to choose the topics you are interested in. 
Then, it displays a list of pictures based on your preferences. The ads on the application are usually helpful
as they are websites to buy things that are similar of what you are searching for. It is a nice source to search
about various topics and can be useful in many ways. For example, I would spend hours browsing fashion ideas on 
what to wear on formal events or daily wear. When I click on a picture, it displays relevant pictures at the bottom
to the one I chose. I also use this application to search for screen wallpapers or profile pictures to use on my 
phone or social media accounts. Another use is browsing for hairstyles that I want to try. Other than browsing, 
you can upload your own pictures privately or publicly and comment on the other usersâ€™ pictures if you would like to
know more about them. You can also share any picture you like to your friends. Overall, the many pictures I look at
can inspire me to try new things in my life or influence new ideas to spend my day productively.
