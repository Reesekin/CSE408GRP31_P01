In my opinion, Twitter is the most classic mobile app people use to connect. 
The art part for twitter is just easy to save, easy to follow, and easy to move on. 
It’s what the internet looks like at the beginning and I think it should be. 
It’s a very good place people can tell them opening and making group with each other. 
Also, I very much like twitter’s trend mod that can tell you what is going on in the world. 
You can find out what group of people are the most popular and join the group and check how 
different talk about this group. Compared with for example Instagram, on Twitter, you don't 
have to make any friends or send any requests. All you need to do is check the topic and talk 
about what you think about it. Also, you can pick what is your interests not let the computer 
decide what might be your interest too. Also a good part and also might be a downside is that 
Twitter is very difficult to give ads based on how it works. Even if there is an ad the impact 
would be as big as Tiktok or Instagram because Twitter is a place user choice, not a place the 
app gives.
