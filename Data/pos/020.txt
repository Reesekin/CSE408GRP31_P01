I was abroad this spring semester with Semester At Sea, cruising around Europe.
	In each country we tended to get an Airbnb for at least one night in the heart
	of the city. Hence, I used the app a lot and much more than I ever had before.
	I found that I never struggled while using the app and I really liked the way it
	was designed. The search process made it easy to pinpoint certain areas and specify
	what we needed. I also really liked how well the spaces were described using both
	images and text. There were many clear photos and plenty of written information available.
	I also found it simple to contact hosts before, during, and after our stays. The app itself
	is extremely useful and I absolutely support the need for it. The process of booking an
	Airbnb is smoother, cheaper, and occasionally safer than booking a hotel. Plus, hotels
	may not have a comprehensive app and fast communication available. I also like that each
	user and host gets rated each time a stay is booked so that I know what I am getting into
	beforehand. Each tab with information tends to have an icon with it, making the overall
	experience easy and clear.
