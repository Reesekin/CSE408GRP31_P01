Doing taxes through this web application just made it very easy and comfortable (for what the actual process was), compared to the otherwise arduous and stressful process that it otherwise would have taken in the pre-Internet era. The displayed information and tooltips on the application were very well-organized and only displayed to me the relevant information depending on the choices that I had made. In some cases, it also provided a few videos that effectively clarified the process if I had a special, extenuating circumstance. Furthermore, the word choices and image choices in the infographics were very casual and conversational, which minimized the stress involved with the taxpaying process. Its simple instructions and interface led to me being able to complete the entire process (relatively) comfortably within a single sitting, and it felt more like I was being guided with informal conversation rather than being pressured to follow extremely specific instructions.
